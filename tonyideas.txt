Part 1:
Inputs: ideas
Additionals: Perhaps a list of resources, aka oil, gas, trees etc so that the AI can look at any of these resources and think about how they could be affected by the ideas
Outputs: a list of resources, with a +1, 0, or -1 value

Mayhaps Part 2:
Store ideas and it's resources as seperate entities in a database
Therefore, all you have to do is find resources that are similar
If you find similar resources, with semi similar values, then 
each resource should tie itself to a certain idea

Part 3 (Using a feature to see pairs that use the other's resource by reusing or reccling):
Imma be honest idk about this one, but asking the ChatGPT on how to recycle is the only way 
I could think on how to do this
